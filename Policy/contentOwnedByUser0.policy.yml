description: |
  Content owned by a user that is not expected can pose a security risk whereby untrusted users might 
  be able to include malicious code in content. If the unexpected user is "Anonymous", this could 
  mean any site visitor could present a risk if they entered malicious code into content.

  This policy identifies if there are nodes owned by Drupal's Anonymous User.
remediation: |
  Assess whether or not there is a legitimate reason that nodes should be owned by Drupal's Anonymous User on the site.
  If not, assign the appropriate owner to the content.
success: No nodes are owned by Drupal's Anonymous User.
failure: Drupal's Anonymous User owns {{totalnodes}} nodes.
parameters:

    default: 0
